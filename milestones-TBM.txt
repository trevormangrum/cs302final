Outline of Project Milestones for a Minimum Viable Product 
1. Learn the basics of Unity through tutorials and other resources.
2. Develop a basic program to practice using Unity (open a blank window or something similar).
3. Begin work on a simple UI and rendering a map.
4. Work on implementing towers and placing them on the map with collision detection.
5. Work on rendering enemies and having them follow a path. 
6. Test enemy pathfinding with varying paths.
7. Implement tower attacking logic with an algorithm that finds the first enemy that enters the tower's range.
8. Implement in-game currency & tower upgrades that can be purchased with said currency and modify a tower's basic attributes such as range and strength
9. Implement round system so enemies come in pre-determined waves
10. Implement an improved UI and title screen
11. Test the game and fix any bugs that are found.


Stretch Goals
* When a tower is upgraded, its sprite changes to reflect the upgrade
* Multiple enemy types that require specific towers to defeat. 
* Random mode where rounds after a certain round are randomized.
* Difficulty modes where upgrades are more expensive, enemies move faster, and more rounds 


Sprints
Sprint 1: Steps 1-3 
Sprint 2: Steps 4-6
Sprint 3: Steps 7-8
Sprint 4: Steps 9-10
Sprint 5: Step 11
Sprint 6 (if time allows): Add stretch goals and repeat step 11
