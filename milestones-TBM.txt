Outline of Project Milestones for a Minimum Viable Product 
1. Learn the basics of Unity through tutorials and other resources.
2. Develop a basic program to practice using Unity (open a blank window or something similar).
3. Begin work on a simple UI and rendering a map.
4. Work on implementing towers and placing them on the map with collision detection.
5. Work on rendering enemies and having them follow a path. 
6. Test enemy pathfinding with varying paths.
7. Implement tower attacking logic with an algorithm that finds the first enemy that enters the tower's range.
8. Implement in-game currency & tower upgrades that can be purchased with said currency and modify a tower's basic attributes such as range and strength
9. Implement round system so enemies come in pre-determined waves
10. Implement an improved UI and title screen
11. Test the game and fix any bugs that are found.


Stretch Goals
* When a tower is upgraded, its sprite changes to reflect the upgrade
* Multiple enemy types that require specific towers to defeat. 
* Random mode where rounds after a certain round are randomized.
* Difficulty modes where upgrades are more expensive, enemies move faster, and more rounds 


Sprints
Sprint 1: Steps 1-3 
Sprint 2: Steps 4-6
Sprint 3: Steps 7-8
Sprint 4: Steps 9-10
Sprint 5: Step 11
Sprint 6 (if time allows): Add stretch goals and repeat step 11


Project Rubric for First Sprint (40 pts):
10 - Code compiles
10 - Game window successfully opens
5 -  Code commenting, formatting
15 - Simple UI or map is visible in game window


Time Log:
10/18/2021 -- 2 hrs -- Worked on milestones and setting up repo 
10/21/2021 -- 2 hrs -- Worked on learning the basics of the Unity Editor and created a basic Level Select UI.
10/21/2021 -- 2 hrs -- Worked on learning about sprite creation and tilesets/tilemaps to create the first towers/levels.

11/24/2021 -- 2 hrs -- Worked on adding multiple enemies and updating their sprites based on which direction they're facing.
11/25/2021 -- 2 hrs -- Started work on the wave system, ran into a lot of trouble with it 
11/26/2021 -- 2 hrs -- Finished wave system
11/29/2021 -- 2 hrs -- Reworked components of wave system, added more rounds

Summary of what was done: 
My first two hours were spent thinking about the project's milestones and learning about how to use GitHub with Unity. I spent some time setting up the repo and informing my group members on
how the repo is set up. The next two hours I spent looking at tutorials for how to use the Unity Editor and how to make some basic UI elements in the Unity Editor. My final two hours were spent
researching how Unity uses sprites and tilesets/tilemaps to render graphics to the window. I also looked at programs that could be used to create art. Some of the programs I looked at included Clip
Art Studio, Pixelorama, GIMP, and Krita. I am currently looking into scripting events in the UI, and I am also about to start working on some basic assets for the game.
