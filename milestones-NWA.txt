Objectives for challenge: 
1. Learn the basics of Unity and get some exposure to how scripting works
2. Create a sample project to get a feel for how creating a project works
3. Add a game object and write a script that compiles and affects the object
4. Begin to work on UI design for the title screen for the main project
5. Have the UI design compile and take the user into the game
6. Create a basic entity for the game
7. Add a feature to the entity
8. Start to think about how we can implement Dijkstra's algorithm in our game

Project Rubric - 40 Points:
25 - UI Design for project is implemented and compiles
10 - Script is successfully added to an entity and compiles
5 - Code formatting, commenting

I thought this challenge worked out really well because it made me start the project, which is usually the hardest part of large projects, and now I know the basics of Unity and can think about how I want to implement the project.
