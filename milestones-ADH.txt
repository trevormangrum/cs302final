Report: I have had issues trying to add a branch to github, I think I need to set up my repo better on my machine
I'm asking my group members if they have any suggestions. I'll have it fully uploaded to the repo hopefully by the time you grade this assignment. I spent much more
time than I wanted watching videos to learn unity, but after doing the 2D platformer template and the Lego template
I feel very comfortable using it's UI. WHile doing the advanced 2D template I have learned a lot but still need
to learn a little more before I'm comfortable using Unity outside of the basic UI (scene game investigator window)











Ask about speed targetting
setup each tower type to inherit and only overide the curr target function

Darwin-targets weakest
Lingbergh- Targets flying
Dickens- targets with low gold reward
sheen-target random but deals double damage

why not just use one list and do enemies.data

Basic- 
Darwin-targets highest dmg
Lingbergh- Targets flying
Sheen-target random but deals double damage


Add distance check to speed function
