# Manual

CHARLES VS CARLS TOWER DEFENSE

Nolan Askew, Andrew Hines, Trevor Mangrum

Build Instructions

You may download the .exe file from Github to easily run the game. For a better experience
(UI not messed up), you may access the game in Unity. To access the game in Unity,
the project may be cloned from GitHub using "git clone
https://github.com/trevormangrum/cs302final.git", and then opened using Unity Hub

Game Instructions

● Once the game loads, you may press the “Play” button, and then select a level to play the
game

● Once the level loads, you may place towers down by clicking a build button on the side
panel and then dragging the tower to the desired build space and clicking again to place
the tower

● To begin a wave of enemies, press the spacebar

● Once all the enemies have been destroyed or reached the end of the map, you may begin
the next wave

● At any time, you may press the escape key to pause the game and either resume, return to
the title screen, or quit the game

● Enemies drop money on death, and this may be used to purchase more towers

● Once you have passed all rounds, you win! Try another level

Known Bugs

● For the best experience, run the game within Unity, but for convenience, you may use the
.exe file. The UI was designed in Unity, so if the project is opened with the .exe file, the
UI will likely be off depending on the screen resolution being used, but the game should
still be playable. If the tower build buttons aren’t visible, then the project may need to be
opened in Unity or another screen may need to be used

● Once all the rounds have been beaten, the rounds display at the top messes up, and there
is no Game Won screen, as it had issues in development, and wasn’t able to be fixed in
time

● Sometimes there is a rare bug in which rounds are not able to be spawned, which happens
randomly, and we believe it is an issue with a variable going out of range or something of
the like. If this happens, the game needs to be restarted

● The player is able to place towers on the paths in the levels, since we weren’t able to
figure out a way to prevent this in time for the project to be due

● The first bullet from the towers each round doesn’t go towards any enemies, but the shot
is still registered, so this is just a visual bug
