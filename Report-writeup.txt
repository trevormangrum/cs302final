Meetings
We did most of our communications through a group chat throughout the entirety of the project
in which we discussed directions we wanted the project to go, issues with the project, and also
updated each other on what we were working on.
10/26/21 -- Met after class for 20 minutes to discuss which data structure we wanted to use for
our project. We decided we didn’t want to use Dijkstra’s anymore and instead just use waypoints
for pathfinding for the enemies
11/11/21 -- Further discussed which data structure/algorithm we wanted to use for our BYOS
presentation. We decided we wanted to use and present quicksort.
11/18/21 -- After our presentation and working on the project more, we decided to just use
lists/queues as our data structures for the projects. The waypoints were used in a way similar to
queues and all of the enemies were kept in a list for the towers to target specific enemies based
on their attributes.
11/28/21 -- Met on discord for 30 minutes to discuss and assign final tasks for us to work on to
complete our project.
11/29/21 -- Met in the afternoon for about an hour to resolve a conflict with git
11/29/21 -- Met at night for an hour to discuss final additions to the project and also debug issue
with tower placements
Manual
CHARLES VS CARLS TOWER DEFENSE

Build Instructions
You may download the .exe file from Github to run the game. To access the game in Unity,
the project may be cloned from GitHub using "git clone
https://github.com/trevormangrum/cs302final.git", and then opened using Unity Hub
Game Instructions
● Once the game loads, you may press the “Play” button, and then select a level to play the
game
● Once the level loads, you may place towers down by clicking a build button on the side
panel and then dragging the tower to the desired build space and clicking again to place
the tower
● To begin a wave of enemies, press the spacebar
● Once all the enemies have been destroyed or reached the end of the map, you may begin
the next wave
● At any time, you may press the escape key to pause the game and either resume, return to
the title screen, or quit the game
● Enemies drop money on death, and this may be used to purchase more towers
● Once you have passed all rounds, you win! Try another level
Known Bugs
● For the best experience, run the game within Unity, but for convenience, you may use the
.exe file. The UI was designed in Unity, so if the project is opened with the .exe file, the
UI will likely be off depending on the screen resolution being used, but the game should
still be playable. If the tower build buttons aren’t visible, then the project may need to be
opened in Unity or another screen may need to be used
● Once all the rounds have been beaten, the rounds display at the top messes up, and there
is no Game Won screen, as it had issues in development, and wasn’t able to be fixed in
time
● Sometimes there is a rare bug in which rounds are not able to be spawned, which happens
randomly, and we believe it is an issue with a variable going out of range or something of
the like. If this happens, the game needs to be restarted
● The player is able to place towers on the paths in the levels, since we weren’t able to
figure out a way to prevent this in time for the project to be due
● The first bullet from the towers each round doesn’t go towards any enemies, but the shot
is still registered, so this is just a visual bug
